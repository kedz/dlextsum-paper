%\hal{i'm having a hard time understanding what's new and what's prior work here.}

%\kathy{This section feels very long. Do you think all the formulas are needed? They take up a lot of space. Would be good for Hal and Chris H to see this comment.}
%\hal{agree. this section is about 3 pages long. i would suggest moving low-level details to an appendix which can be submitted as supplemental. i've added toappendix.sty to make this easy. i've given an example usage in the RNN encoder section which i think you can use throughout. i also added a makefile that will split the paper into main and supllemental}



%Depending on the architectural choices of each component we propose we

%\cite{nallapati}, which we outline below.
