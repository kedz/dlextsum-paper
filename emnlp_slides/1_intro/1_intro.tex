%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item Most research has focused on news.
%    \item Recent increased interest since 2016. \textbf{Why?}
%      \begin{itemize}
%        \item CNN/DailyMail Dataset (300k document summary pairs)
%        \item More recently the Newsroom dataset offers 1.3 million training 
%              examples
%        \item General purpose sequence-to-sequence transduction models from the
%              Neural Machine Translation community
%      \end{itemize}
%    \item <2-> Will this approach work?
%      \begin{itemize}
%        \item<2-> With enough data, we can treat the model as a black box.
%        \item<2-> Avoid having to specify summarization model task which is 
%                  complex/unknown/underspecified.
%      \end{itemize}
%    \item<3-> \textbf{This Talk:} Reasons to be skeptical that this will work.
