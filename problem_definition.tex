In this paper, we model sentence extraction task as a sequence tagging problem, following \cite{} \hal{need cites here}.
Specifically, given a document containing $\docsize$ sentences $\sent_1, \ldots, 
\sent_{\docsize}$ we generate a summary by predict a corresponding label sequence $\slabel_1,
\ldots, \slabel_{\docsize} \in \{0, 1\}^{\docsize}$, where $\slabel_i = 1$ 
indicates the $i$-th sentence is to be included in the summary.
The word budget enforces a constraint that \hal{fill in}.
\hal{maybe introduce some more notation here, like $s$ is a sequence of $w$s, etc. i think that might be all you need.}
